Breaks takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

## Location Data

When you choose to find surf spots near you, we will ask for permission to access your current location in order to determine that. This information is not stored in any way, and we will not share it with other users or partners.

If you do not want us to use your location, you can simply hide the location-related UI elements and/or turn off access in your iOS settings.

## Personal Data

**We collect no personal data at all. Nothing.** Everything you do is saved on-device except for your favorites, which is uploaded to our servers to allow syncing across your devices. This will be saved against your randomly-generated identifier provided to us by Apple, which cannot be used to track you between apps.

## Any Questions?
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please donâ€™t hesitate to [contact us](mailto:pxlshpr@gmail.com).
